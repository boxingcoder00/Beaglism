                    <p>We have been releasing content week by week to the world, so that we can fulfill our mission of education, information, and in the not-so-distant future be able to lend a real helping hand to our beloved beagles.</p>

                    <p>This week we released our article on <a href="/Resources/BeagleAdoptnotShop.html">5 Reasons Why You Should Adopt and Not Shop for a Pet</a> that will go into detail on why adoption should be the choice over shopping.</p>

                    <p>We truly hope this small article can make an impact, even if it just helps a few beagles be given a better life.</p>

                    <p>In other news, our Instagram page is almost at 100 followers! Although this is a small feed, it is a milestone in our book, while we develop and slowly expand behind the scenes.</p>
