                <div class="reason-description">
                    When you adopt from a shelter or rescue organization, you're giving a second chance to an animal that might otherwise face euthanasia. An animal that mhas been abandoned , Approximately 6.3 million companion animals enter U.S. shelters annually, and giving one of these animals a loving home makes a real huge difference. Many beagles are used for 
                    testing on toxic chemicals amongst other things we rather not get into but always remember adopting a beagle(animal in general)will always be one of the biggest forms of help you can do in life.

                <div class="reason-description">
                    When you shop for pets from certain retailers, you may inadvertently support puppy millsâ€”commercial breeding facilities that prioritize profit over animal welfare. These operations often keep animals in poor conditions and contribute to pet overpopulation.Some of these mills also sell to these compoanies of whom experiment on beagles and other animals. 
                    This can be drastically reduced by avoiding many of them as much as possible.

                <div class="reason-title">3. Get a Well-Assessed Pet</div>
                <div class="reason-description">
                    Shelter staff and foster families often have extensive knowledge about each animal's personality, behaviors, and needs. This a great asset to you, it helps ensure you find a pet whose temperament matches your lifestyle unlike buying from a breeder where you might not know how the animal will behave in a home environment.This can play great in your favor , buying from a mill can be bad for the reasons above but also the animal may not be suitable to the new owner thus, the chances of abandonment go up.

                <div class="reason-title">4. Adopt a Pet That's Already Trained</div>
                <div class="reason-description">
                    Many shelter animals have previously lived in homes in turn can make life a bit easier when introducing an animal into a new home and may already know basic commands, be house-trained, and understand how to interact with humans. This can make the transition to your home smoother compared to starting from scratch with a puppy or kitten.

              <div class="reason-title">5. You get a system of support </div>
              <div class="reason-description">
                When you buy from a pet store, the relationship usually ends at checkout. 
                They rarely have info on the pet or help if problems come up later. But shelters and rescues actually know their animals - likes, dislikes, quirks and all. 
                They're invested in making sure your new buddy settles in well and are happy to answer questions even after you take them home. 
                They genuinely want the match to work out!

          <div class="adoption-footer">
            In conclusion, adoption should be considered over shopping. Getting an animal is a lifetime commitment. Giving a chance to one who was promised this commitment at a young age only to be abandoned, or who spent their early years neglected or poorly treated, is something that should make you thankful and proud. Giving this second chance , is something you can look back on with the memories you made and smile.
