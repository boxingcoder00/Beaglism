                <div class="facts-list">
                    <div class="fact">
                        <h3><span class="fact-number">1.</span> Beagles Have 220 Million Scent Receptors</h3>
                        <p>Beagles possess approximately 220 million scent receptors, while humans only have about 5 million. This extraordinary olfactory system gives them one of the most powerful noses in the canine world, second only to Bloodhounds.</p>
                        
                        <p>This remarkable scenting ability isn't just impressive—it's practical. Beagles can detect and distinguish between thousands of different scents, which is why they've been historically used for hunting rabbits and hares. Their nose is so powerful that they can follow scent trails that are days old.</p>
                        
                        <p>This trait also explains why your beagle seems magnetically drawn to every interesting smell during walks, often making simple outings into extended scent investigations!

                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="fact">
                        <h3><span class="fact-number">2.</span> The White Tail Tip Served a Practical Purpose</h3>
                        <p>The white tip on many beagles' tails, called a "flag," isn't just decorative—it evolved as a practical hunting feature. This distinctive marking helped hunters spot their dogs when they were running through tall grass or dense underbrush.</p>
                        
                        <p>When beagles would pick up a scent and chase prey through fields or forests, their bodies might be hidden by vegetation, but that white-tipped tail would remain visible, bobbing above the grass like a flag. This allowed hunters to follow their dogs and know when they were on the trail of game.</p>
                        
                        <p>Today, while most beagles aren't used for hunting, many still carry this characteristic marking as a reminder of their working heritage.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="fact">
                        <h3><span class="fact-number">3.</span> Beagles Have a Unique Vocalization Called "Baying"</h3>
                        <p>Beagles have a unique vocalization called "baying" that's distinctly different from regular barking. This melodious three-octave howl was specifically bred into them to alert hunters when they found prey during a hunt.</p>
                        
                        <p>Unlike a standard bark, baying is a prolonged, musical howl that can carry over long distances. It's the beagle's way of saying "I found something!" and was crucial for pack hunting, allowing other dogs and hunters to converge on the location.</p>
                        
                        <p>Modern beagle owners are very familiar with this vocalization, especially when their dog hears sirens, gets excited about dinner time, or wants attention. While it can be loud, it's an integral part of the beagle personality and heritage!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="fact">
                        <h3><span class="fact-number">4.</span> NASA Sent Beagles to Space</h3>
                        <p>In the 1950s, NASA used beagles in their research programs because of the breed's calm temperament and manageable size. Several beagles were sent to space to test the biological effects of spaceflight before humans made the journey.</p>
                        
                        <p>These pioneering beagles contributed valuable data about how living organisms respond to the extreme conditions of space travel, including weightlessness and cosmic radiation. Their missions helped pave the way for human spaceflight.</p>
                        
                        <p>While this chapter of beagle history is bittersweet—many of these early space dogs didn't survive their missions—their contributions to space exploration and scientific understanding were significant and helped advance our knowledge of space travel.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="fact">
                        <h3><span class="fact-number">5.</span> The Name "Beagle" Has French Origins</h3>
                        <p>The name "Beagle" may come from the French word "begueule," which means "open throat" or "loudmouth." This etymology perfectly describes one of the breed's most distinctive characteristics—their vocal nature.</p>
                        
                        <p>Another theory suggests the name comes from the French word "beugler," meaning "to bellow," or the Gaelic word "beag," meaning "small." All of these origins point to either the beagle's size or their impressive vocal abilities.</p>
                        
                        <p>Regardless of which theory is correct, it's clear that the beagle's tendency to be vocal has been recognized and celebrated throughout history!</p>

                    <div class="fact">
                        <h3><span class="fact-number">6.</span> Those Floppy Ears Enhance Their Sense of Smell</h3>
                        <p>Beagles' long, droopy ears aren't just adorable—they're actually functional tools that enhance their scenting abilities. The ears' unique shape helps trap scents and waft them toward the dog's nose, making their already remarkable smelling abilities even more powerful.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a beagle's head moves close to the ground while tracking, those long ears sweep across the surface, stirring up scent particles and directing them toward the nose. It's like having built-in scent funnels!</p>
                        
                        <p>However, those floppy ears do require special care. They can trap moisture and debris, making beagles prone to ear infections. Regular ear cleaning is essential for keeping your beagle healthy. Learn more in our <a href="./Beaglegrooming">beagle grooming guide</a>.</p>

                        <h3><span class="fact-number">7.</span> Beagles Are an Ancient Breed</h3>
                        <p>The beagle breed is remarkably ancient. Similar small scent hounds were mentioned in documents from Ancient Greece dating back to the 5th century BCE. These early ancestors of modern beagles were used for hunting small game.</p>
                        
                        <p>The breed we recognize today began to take shape in England during the 1830s, when Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a beagle pack that became the foundation for the modern breed. However, small scent hounds resembling beagles have existed for millennia.</p>
                        
                        <p>This long history means beagles have been refined and perfected over centuries, resulting in the wonderful companions we know today. Their enduring popularity across different eras and cultures speaks to their exceptional qualities as both working dogs and family pets.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="fact">
                        <h3><span class="fact-number">8.</span> Beagles Detect Bedbugs Professionally</h3>
                        <p>Thanks to their incredible scent detection abilities and small size, beagles have found a modern career detecting bedbugs in hotels, homes, and other buildings. Their compact stature allows them to search tight spaces that would be difficult for larger dogs or humans to access.</p>
                        
                        <p>These specially trained detection beagles can identify bedbug infestations with remarkable accuracy—often over 90%—which is significantly higher than visual inspections by humans. They can detect even small numbers of bedbugs or their eggs, catching infestations early.</p>
                        
                        <p>This work demonstrates how beagles' natural hunting and scenting instincts can be adapted for modern practical applications, proving they're not just great pets but also valuable working dogs in today's world.</p>

                        <h3><span class="fact-number">9.</span> Uno Made Westminster History in 2008</h3>
                        <p>A beagle named Uno became the first of his breed to win "Best in Show" at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 2008.

                        <h3><span class="fact-number">10.</span> "Beagle Pain Syndrome" Is Breed-Specific</h3>
                        <p>Beagles are one of the few dog breeds that can develop a condition called "Beagle Pain Syndrome," more formally known as Steroid Responsive Meningitis-Arteritis (SRMA). This inflammatory disease affects the blood vessels and membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.</p>
                        
                        <p>While this sounds concerning, there's good news: when caught early, Beagle Pain Syndrome responds well to treatment with corticosteroids. Most dogs make a full recovery with proper veterinary care and medication.</p>
                        
                        <p>Symptoms typically include fever, neck pain, and reluctance to move. If your beagle shows these signs, prompt veterinary attention is essential. Being aware of breed-specific health issues is an important part of responsible beagle ownership.
