    <h1>10 Less Known but! Fun Facts About Beagles!</h1>
    
    <div class="facts-list">
        <div class="fact">
            <span class="fact-number">1.</span>
            Beagles have approximately 220 million scent receptors, while humans only have about 5 million. This gives them one of the most powerful noses in the canine world, second only to Bloodhounds.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fact">
            <span class="fact-number">2.</span>
            The white tip on many Beagles' tails (called a "flag") evolved as a practical feature - it helped hunters spot their dogs when they were running through tall grass or underbrush.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fact">
            <span class="fact-number">3.</span>
            Beagles have a unique vocalization called "baying" that's different from barking. This three-octave howl was specifically bred into them to alert hunters when they found prey during a hunt.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fact">
            <span class="fact-number">4.</span>
            NASA has used Beagles in research programs because of their calm temperament and size. In the 1950s, they sent several Beagles to space to test the biological effects of spaceflight.

        <div class="fact">
            <span class="fact-number">5.</span>
            The name "Beagle" may come from the French word "begueule," meaning "open throat" or "loudmouth," referring to their distinctive vocalization.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fact">
            <span class="fact-number">6.</span>
            Beagles' ears are actually functional beyond just hearing - the long, droopy shape helps trap scents and waft them toward their noses, enhancing their already remarkable smelling abilities.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fact">
            <span class="fact-number">7.</span>
            The Beagle breed is so ancient that similar small scent hounds were mentioned in documents from Ancient Greece dating back to the 5th century BCE.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fact">
            <span class="fact-number">8.</span>
            Beagles have been used in detecting bedbugs in hotels and homes due to their incredible scent detection abilities and small size, which allows them to search tight spaces.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fact">
            <span class="fact-number">9.</span>
            A Beagle named Uno became the first of his breed to win "Best in Show" at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 2008, despite Beagles being one of America's most popular breeds for decades.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fact">
            <span class="fact-number">10.</span>
            Beagles are one of the few dog breeds that can develop a condition called "Beagle Pain Syndrome" (Steroid Responsive Meningitis-Arteritis), an inflammatory disease that, thankfully, responds well to treatment when caught early.
