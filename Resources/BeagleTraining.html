            </div>
            <div class="beagle-tip-content">
              <p>Start training your beagle pup right when you get them home. Those first few weeks really matter for setting up good habits for life. Make sure everyone in your family uses the same commands and stays consistent. Beagles love routine, so try to keep meals, walks, and training sessions on a regular schedule.</p>

              <span class="beagle-tip-number">2</span>

            </div>
            <div class="beagle-tip-content">
              <p>Beagles are total suckers for reward training. These little guys are major foodies, so treats work like magic. Figure out what really gets your beagle excited—tiny bits of cheese, chicken, or store-bought training treats usually do the trick, blue berries did the trick for us. Just make sure you reward them right away when they do something good so they connect the dots between what they did and getting that tasty reward.</p>

              <h2 class="beagle-tip-title">Keep Training Sessions Short</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="beagle-tip-content">
              <p>Beagles have relatively short attention spans, especially as puppies. Keep your training sessions brief but frequent—5-10 minute sessions several times throughout the day are more effective than one long session. Always end on a positive note with a command they know well, ensuring they associate training with success and enjoyment.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="beagle-tip-content">
              <p>Beagles are scent hounds with an incredibly powerful urge to follow their nose. This natural instinct can make them appear stubborn or distracted during training. Practice solid recall commands in gradually more distracting environments(Its important to not give up!). Start indoors, then move to a fenced yard, and finally to more challenging settings. Never let your beagle off-leash in unsecured areas until their recall is absolutely reliable.</p>

              <h2 class="beagle-tip-title">Socialize Extensively</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="beagle-tip-content">
              <p>Proper socialization is CRITICAL for beagles. Expose your beagle to various people, dogs, environments, and situations from an early age. Start socialization as soon as your veterinarian says it's safe. Make these experiences positive with treats and praise to prevent fear or aggression issues. Well-socialized beagles are typically friendly, confident, and adaptable companions.</p>

              <h2 class="beagle-tip-title">Be Patient with Housetraining</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="beagle-tip-content">
              <p>Beagles can take longer to housetrain than some other breeds due to them being stubborn. Establish a consistent schedule with frequent, scheduled bathroom breaks. Take your beagle outside first thing in the morning, after meals, after play sessions, and before bedtime. Supervise closely indoors or use a crate when you can't watch them. Praise and reward successful outdoor elimination immediately and never punish accidents.</p>

              <span class="beagle-tip-number">7</span>
              <h2 class="beagle-tip-title">Prevent Boredom and Destructive Behavior</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="beagle-tip-content">
              <p>Beagles are active, intelligent dogs that need both physical and mental stimulation. Provide at least one hour of physical exercise daily through walks, play sessions, or supervised yard time. Offer mental stimulation through puzzle toys, nose work activities, and training games. Rotate toys regularly to keep things interesting and prevent destructive behaviors that stem from boredom. Something we do for our beagles is put peanut butter treats inside a toy, it keeps them busy for a long time!</p>
