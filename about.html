            <p1> 

                Growing up, my family had no pets. My parents always said we had no time to care for them (and looking back, my mother was right). 
                
                But when my sister and I got older, everything changed when we welcomed our first dog into our home—a beautiful beagle named Princess!

                From the moment Princess arrived, we fell head over heels in love. She was not only beautiful but incredibly intelligent, quickly becoming an irreplaceable member of our family. 
                
                Sadly, we lost Princess at a young age, leaving a void in our hearts that felt impossible to fill.

                In time, we welcomed two more beagles into our home. These playful companions were an absolute howl to have around (get it? hah!). 
                
                As the years passed, my love for the breed only deepened, especially through interactions with fellow beagle enthusiasts at the local dog park.

                It was during one of these park visits that "Beaglism" first came to mind—a way to give back to beagles and all dogs for the countless happy memories they've brought into my life.                     
                                
                As a result, we are now here ...<br> <br>
                
                Beaglism: A Movement Like No Other!<br> <br>

                At Beaglism, we're all about spreading the word on beagles! We want to shine a light on how these awesome dogs are sometimes mistreated and help people learn more about them.

                Our mission is to share the happiness and joy these furry friends bring through social media, newsletters, and whatever else we can use. 
                
                We create one-of-a-kind merchandise that helps fund donations and charity work as a way to make a real difference.

                Anyone can join us – doesn't matter if you have a beagle, another dog, or just love dogs in general!
                
                Join us in spreading the Beaglism movement!
