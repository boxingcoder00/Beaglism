                        <div class="a-text">Iker arrived thanks to Dalí. I love that breed. I love Snoopy, and when I found out he was a beagle, I started reading to learn about the breed. That's how I came to Dalí, my first Bigolito, and it was a wonderful experience. When Dalí passed away, I needed some time to heal the wounds of loss and didn't think about having another beagle; in fact, I was looking to adopt a greyhound. <br><br>But one day, an acquaintance contacted me because there was a little beagle up for adoption. He was two years old and had already been abandoned several times, had been through four families, and obviously there were some problems. I just know that Dalí united us, and that's how we met, and we began this love story.<br><br> I adopted my second beagle, certain that Dali had united us, because he was a dog in a lot of pain, which is why he had a complicated character. I adopted him, we adopted him, and I renamed him because I thought that with a new name, I could leave his heartbreak behind and start his new life. And so Iker was born, at the end of November 2020. Leaving abuse behind and ready to learn what it means to be loved. And yes... it was love at first sight.</div>

Iker was sleeping, unaware of what had happened, an innocent little thing, and when I went to look at him... his snout and ears were white. He'd obviously been attacked by the package of flour.
                            The most emotional thing was when, after long months of treatment to correct his behavior, one day he started looking at me and talking a lot with his little eyes. Iker didn't look at me; he was a bundle of nerves who couldn't express anything with those beautiful eyes. Today, glances are our greatest connection. I know he understands me, and he knows I can understand him.</div>

                            He's also very good at opening doors, and one day I found the closet doors open and snack containers on the bed that he should have eaten in a week, and he devoured them in two hours, all alone.
                            Dali, yes, he got into a lot of pranks until he was one year old. The most memorable one was the day we came home and found a long trail of sawdust; he had eaten most of one of the legs of the dining room table.</div>

                        <div class="a-text">Personally, I think they're the most beautiful breed. They're extremely beautiful and fun, but they're often misunderstood, which is why they're the most abandoned breed. They're very intelligent, stubborn, and have incredible personalities. Anyone who wants a beagle to share their days with must keep in mind their characteristics. But above all, a pet is not a toy; love is forever, and it entails a great deal of responsibility, care, and education.</div>
