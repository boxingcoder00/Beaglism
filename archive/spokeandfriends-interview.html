                <div class="q-text">Do each of your beagles have distinct personalities? What's the difference?</div>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="a-label">A:</div>
                <div class="a-text">Yes, the three of them are very different.
                    Spock is the calmest, doesn't like to party or roughhousing. He's very manipulative, and when he wants something, he gets it. He rolls his eyes, but he's not at all afraid.
                    Kirk has the strongest character; he's very dominant, and knows how to bully the other two in his own way. When he wants something, he annoys them. And how does Kirk bully them? This may be laughable, but he does it. He puts his butt in their faces and pushes them and corners them against the wall all by himself. In that sense, he's very intelligent. But it must also be said that he's very fearful; he doesn't like rainy days or thunder.
                    Ahsoka is very sweet, cheerful, and flirtatious. She likes roughhousing, partying, and is always looking for someone to play with, even with humans. But she's also fearful, and doesn't like rainy days or thunder.</div>

                <div class="a-text">The three of them get along very well, and I think it's because they were raised together since they were little, which has greatly influenced their upbringing. I won't deny that they've had their arguments from time to time, always with Kirk, who is the dominant one. But as a guardian, I've known how to manage each one's behavior at the right time and time to ensure respect between them.
                Kirk is the pack leader; he's very dominant and the alpha male... and if there's something he doesn't like, he knows how to express it very well.</div>

                <div class="a-text"> The first to arrive is Spock. I had just lost my cocker spaniel (Rocky), who had died at age 16 from kidney failure. I was very sick and devastated since we were very close. My husband was also ill, and a coworker of his advised us to look for another furry friend since that was the best way to deal with the grief and would help us recover from such a strong blow. My husband asked me what breed I liked and I told him beagle, and that's when the search began. Spock arrived at 40 days old. I was so fascinated by this breed that at age 2 I decided to look for another one and give Spock a companion to play with, and that's how Kirk arrived. After 6 years, my oldest son wanted one and Ahsoka arrived.

                <div class="a-text">Beagles are very energetic, hungry dogs with a keen sense of smell, 
                                    but they are also very sweet and affectionate. 
                                    They are very affectionate with humans and do not like to be left alone at all. However, I also consider them to be very special beings and excellent companions for children with disabilities. Beagles, despite their energy and tireless sense of smell, are excellent pets to keep at home and also like being with people. If they are well trained and educated, they can become excellent pets. For me, they are one of the best breeds, as long as their owner is a responsible person who knows and meets all their needs. For me, they are magical beings and unique beings, and if I had to choose again, 
                                    I would choose a Beagle again.</div>
