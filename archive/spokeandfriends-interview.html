                <div class="a-label">A:</div>
                <div class="a-text">The first to arrive is Spock. I had just lost my cocker spaniel (Rocky), who had died at age 16 from kidney failure. I was very sick and devastated since we were very close. 
                                    My husband was also ill, and a coworker of his advised us to look for another furry friend since that was the best way to deal with the grief and would help us recover from such a strong blow. My husband asked me what breed I liked and I told him beagle, and that's when the search began. 
                                    Spock arrived at 40 days old. I was so fascinated by this breed that at age 2 I decided to look for another one and give Spock a companion to play with, and that's how Kirk arrived. After 6 years, 
                                    my oldest son wanted one and Ahsoka arrived.</div>

                                    but they are also very sweet and affectionate. 
                                    They are very affectionate with humans and do not like to be left alone at all. However, I also consider them to be very special beings and excellent companions for children with disabilities. Beagles, despite their energy and tireless sense of smell, are excellent pets to keep at home and also like being with people. If they are well trained and educated, they can become excellent pets. For me, they are one of the best breeds, as long as their owner is a responsible person who knows and meets all their needs. For me, they are magical beings and unique beings, and if I had to choose again, 
                                    I would choose a Beagle again.</div>
