        <h1>Companies and Facilities to Avoid: Beagle Experimentation and Animal Rights Protests</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="intro">
        <p>Animal testing on beagles has become a major ethical concern, with approximately 44,000 dogs used annually in experimentation in the United States. Beagles are particularly favored by researchers due to their docile, trusting nature and well-documented genetics, making them tragically ideal subjects for laboratory testing.</p>
    </div>

    <section>
        <h2>Major Breeding Facilities and Testing Companies</h2>

        <h3>Ridglan Farms (Blue Mounds, Wisconsin)</h3>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Agreed to close breeding operations by July 2026 after years of activism</p>
        
        <p>Ridglan Farms was the second-largest research dog breeder in the United States, housing over 3,000 beagles. After a special prosecutor investigation launched in January 2025, the facility agreed to surrender its breeding license to avoid criminal prosecution.</p>

        <p><strong>Violations and Concerns:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Former employees testified to cutting off dogs' eyelids and vocal cords without anesthetic or veterinary licenses</li>
            <li>Over 300 citations from the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection for animal welfare violations</li>
            <li>Noticeable ammonia odors and improper waste disposal documented in 2022 and 2024 reports</li>
            <li>Nearly 275 beagles died annually while still at the breeding facility</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>University Connection:</strong> The University of Wisconsin-Madison purchased 19 dogs from Ridglan between January 2022 and July 2025, though this represented less than 2% of Ridglan's sales.</p>

        <h3>Marshall BioResources (North Rose, Wayne County, New York)</h3>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Currently operating - ongoing protests</p>
        
        <p>Marshall is one of the largest breeding facilities in the country for canines used in animal research, breeding thousands of beagles annually. The company also breeds Marshall Cats and Göttingen minipigs for research.</p>

        <p><strong>Protests:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regular demonstrations have been held at the facility since 2020</li>
            <li>Activists argue the facility operates as a "puppy farm"</li>
            <li>Animal rights groups continue efforts to shut down the operation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>MBR Acres (Wyton, Cambridgeshire, UK)</h3>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Currently operating - subject to longest-lasting protest camp</p>
        
        <p>Camp Beagle, established in June 2021, has maintained a permanent presence outside this facility owned by Marshall BioResources. Up to 2,000 beagles are bred at the facility annually and sold at approximately 16 weeks old for drug and chemical testing.</p>

        <p><strong>Notable Incidents:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>In December 2022, activists freed 18 beagles from the facility</li>
            <li>Singer Will Young handcuffed himself to the facility gates in November 2021</li>
            <li>Nine campaigners were found guilty of aggravated trespass in July 2023</li>
            <li>Protests have included "Operation 1,000" with 400-500 demonstrators</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Envigo RMS LLC (Cumberland, Virginia)</h3>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> CLOSED - Facility shut down in 2022</p>
        
        <p>Envigo, owned by parent company Inotiv, pleaded guilty in 2024 to animal welfare and environmental crimes and was fined a record $35 million. The company became the first-ever federally convicted supplier of animals for experimentation.</p>

        <p><strong>Violations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nearly 4,000 beagles were rescued from the facility</li>
            <li>Dogs were killed instead of receiving veterinary treatment for easily treatable conditions</li>
            <li>Nursing mother beagles were denied food</li>
            <li>Food provided contained maggots, mold, and feces</li>
            <li>25 beagle puppies died from cold exposure over an eight-week period</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Settlement Terms:</strong> As part of the agreement, no Inotiv entities, including Envigo, will be allowed to breed or sell dogs again.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Testing Laboratories and Contract Research Organizations</h2>

        <h3>Inotiv (Mount Vernon, Indiana)</h3>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Currently operating - subject of major investigations</p>
        
        <p>This contract research organization has faced intense scrutiny following a seven-month undercover investigation by the Humane Society of the United States.</p>

        <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>80 beagle puppies used in toxicity testing commissioned by pharmaceutical companies</li>
            <li>Dogs force-fed potentially toxic drugs via stomach tubes daily for months</li>
            <li>Animals continued receiving doses even when vomiting, shaking, having high fevers and labored breathing</li>
            <li>Laboratory veterinarians did not always assess or treat severely sick dogs due to "personal inconvenience"</li>
            <li>At least two primates accidentally hanged themselves in restraint chairs</li>
            <li>Most animals killed at the end of studies</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Pharmaceutical Companies Connected:</strong> The investigation documented over 70 toxicity studies commissioned by more than two dozen pharmaceutical companies, including prominent work for <strong>Crinetics Pharmaceuticals</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Crinetics Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, California)</h3>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Facing public pressure and Congressional scrutiny</p>
        
        <p>This pharmaceutical company contracted with Inotiv for toxicology studies on 80 beagle puppies. Despite public outcry, the company has refused to release the dogs for adoption.</p>

        <p><strong>Public Response:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Over 275,000 people signed petitions for the beagles' release</li>
            <li>167 bipartisan lawmakers from 32 states signed a letter requesting the dogs be released instead of euthanized</li>
            <li>Actress Kim Basinger wrote a public letter expressing concern</li>
            <li>The company claims FDA requirements mandate the testing, though advocates dispute this claim</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>National Institutes of Health (NIH) Beagle Laboratory (Bethesda, Maryland)</h3>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> CLOSED - Shut down in May 2025</p>
        
        <p>The NIH's beagle experimentation laboratory operated for over 40 years before being closed by the Trump administration under NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya.</p>

        <p><strong>History:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allegedly killed more than 2,133 beagles in septic shock experiments</li>
            <li>Used beagles from the convicted breeder Envigo</li>
            <li>White Coat Waste Project documented pumping pneumonia-causing bacteria into beagles' lungs</li>
            <li>Dogs were bled out and forced into septic shock for deadly experiments</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What Types of Testing Are Conducted</h2>

        <h3>Toxicology and Safety Testing</h3>
        <p>Dogs are primarily used for testing the toxicity and safety of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Novel pharmaceuticals (overseen by the FDA)</li>
            <li>Pesticides (monitored by the EPA)</li>
            <li>Chemical compounds</li>
            <li>Drug dosing and side effects</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Specific Tests</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>90-Day Pesticide Test:</strong> Forces dozens of dogs to ingest pesticides daily for 90 days, then kills them. Scientific analysis has shown this test provides little to no added value in protecting humans.</li>
            <li><strong>Septic Shock Research:</strong> Testing immune system responses to infections</li>
            <li><strong>Disease Research:</strong> Including studies on conditions like Alzheimer's, cancer, and COVID-19 organ impacts</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Legislative Progress and Hope</h2>

        <h3>FDA Modernization Act 2.0 (2022)</h3>
        <p>This landmark legislation removed the Depression-era mandate requiring animal testing for all new drug candidates. The law opened the door for computer-based models and other alternatives.</p>

        <h3>FDA Modernization Act 3.0 (2024)</h3>
        <p>Passed the U.S. Senate unanimously in December 2024 to compel the FDA to update regulations and allow non-animal test methods.</p>

        <h3>FDA Roadmap (April 2025)</h3>
        <p>FDA Commissioner Dr. Makary announced plans to phase out animal testing requirements for monoclonal antibodies and other drugs, prioritizing human-based research technologies.</p>

        <h3>State-Level Progress</h3>
        <p><strong>17 states</strong> have now enacted laws requiring laboratories to make dogs and cats available for adoption after testing, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Michigan ("Teddy's Law" - 2023)</li>
            <li>Colorado (2023)</li>
            <li>Pennsylvania ("Beagle Bills" - pending)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Beagles?</h2>
        <p>Animal activists and experts note several reasons beagles are disproportionately used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Docile temperament:</strong> They remain trusting even when hurt</li>
            <li><strong>Small size:</strong> Easy to handle and house in laboratories</li>
            <li><strong>Friendly nature:</strong> Unlikely to bite or resist handling</li>
            <li><strong>Well-documented genetics:</strong> Decades of research provide consistent baseline data</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose-bred:</strong> Specific lineages maintained for scientific consistency</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Scientific Reality</h2>
        <p>According to animal welfare advocates and some scientists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Close to 90% of drugs</strong> tested on animals ultimately fail in human trials</li>
            <li><strong>Approximately half</strong> of those failures are due to unexpected toxicity in humans that wasn't observed in animal tests</li>
            <li><strong>Dogs are inconsistent predictors</strong> of toxic responses in humans</li>
            <li><strong>Modern alternatives</strong> (AI, organ-on-chip technology, 3D bioprinting, human cell-based testing) are often more accurate, faster, and cost-effective</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
