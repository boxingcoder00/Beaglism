        <main class="beagle-puzzle-main-content">
            <div class="beagle-puzzle-intro-paragraph">
                Beagles are intelligent, scent-driven dogs that require substantial mental stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive behaviors. Their exceptional sense of smell and natural curiosity make them perfect candidates for DIY puzzle toys that challenge their minds while keeping them entertained. The best part? Most of these engaging activities can be created using common household items you likely already have at home.
            </div>

            <h2 class="beagle-puzzle-section-heading">Why Mental Stimulation Matters for Beagles</h2>
            <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                Beagles were originally bred as hunting dogs, designed to track scents and solve problems independently. This heritage means they have high intelligence and an innate need to use their minds. <span class="beagle-puzzle-emphasis">Mental stimulation is just as important as physical exercise</span> for these energetic dogs, helping to prevent anxiety, destructive behaviors, and excessive barking.
            </p>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-safety-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-safety-title">Essential Safety Considerations</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    Before diving into DIY projects, always ensure materials are dog-safe and non-toxic. Remove any small parts that could pose choking hazards, and supervise your beagle during play, especially with new toys. Replace worn or damaged items immediately to prevent ingestion of harmful materials.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="beagle-puzzle-section-heading">Scent-Based Puzzle Toys</h2>
            
            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">The Cup Game</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    This classic game perfectly suits a beagle's natural problem-solving abilities. Simply place a treat under one of three identical cups and shuffle them around. Train your beagle to indicate which cup contains the treat by pawing or nosing it. They are not the most patient of breeds, but beagles can be totally capable of playing along with The Cup Game!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">DIY Scent Trail</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    Create an engaging scent trail using household items. Put a drop of the same essential oil on five to 10 scraps of paper and create a trail about 20 ft long leading to the ball. Use dog-safe essential oils like eucalyptus, or simple spices like cinnamon mixed with water to create distinct scent markers.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">Hidden Treat Hunt</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    Transform your living space into a treasure hunt by hiding treats throughout the house. Start with obvious locations and gradually increase difficulty as your beagle masters the game. This activity channels their natural tracking instincts while providing mental enrichment.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="beagle-puzzle-section-heading">Puzzle Feeders and Food Dispensers</h2>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">Muffin Tin Treat Puzzle</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    An old muffin tin makes an excellent puzzle feeder. Place treats in each cup and cover with tennis balls. Your beagle must remove each ball to access the reward, creating an engaging problem-solving challenge that slows down eating.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">Cardboard Box Maze</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    All you need is an empty shoebox, cardboard scraps or old socks, scissors, and treats. Create compartments within the box using cardboard dividers, hiding treats throughout the maze. This encourages natural foraging behaviors while providing mental stimulation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">Tennis Ball Food Dispenser</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    Cut a small slit in a tennis ball just large enough for kibble to fall through. Fill the ball with treats or dry food, creating a rolling puzzle that dispenses rewards as your beagle plays with it.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="beagle-puzzle-section-heading">Interactive Construction Projects</h2>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">Busy Box (Destruction Box)</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    Also called an enrichment box, foraging box, or destruction box, a busy box is a super simple DIY interactive puzzle. Fill a cardboard box with paper strips, toilet paper rolls, and small treats. Your beagle can safely "destroy" the box while hunting for rewards.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">Bottle Spinning Toy</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    Create a rotating puzzle using plastic bottles and a dowel or PVC pipe. Mount bottles on the rotating axis and place treats inside. Your beagle must learn to spin the bottles to access the rewards.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">DIY Snuffle Mat</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    While not strictly a household item project, you can create a snuffle mat using rubber sink mats and fleece strips from old clothing. This mimics grass and encourages natural foraging behaviors.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="beagle-puzzle-section-heading">Simple Household Item Puzzles</h2>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">Towel Treat Wraps</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    Roll treats inside old towels or blankets, creating multiple layers your beagle must unroll to access rewards. This simple puzzle provides both mental stimulation and satisfying tactile engagement.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">Ice Cube Treats</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    Freeze treats or small toys inside ice cubes for a cooling puzzle that takes time to solve. This works especially well during hot weather, providing both mental stimulation and temperature relief.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-project-title">Sock Toy Puzzles</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    I take a pair of old socks stuff one inside the other and put a knot around the other one, and they have a blast knocking the socks into their head and body. While simple, this creates an engaging toy that satisfies natural play instincts.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-tip-box">
                <div class="beagle-puzzle-tip-title">Tips for Success</div>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    Start with easier puzzles and gradually increase difficulty as your beagle becomes more skilled. Rotate toys regularly to maintain interest and prevent boredom. Always supervise initial play sessions to ensure safe interaction with new puzzles.
                </p>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    Remember that <span class="beagle-puzzle-highlight">cardboard boxes, plastic cups, empty toilet paper rolls, or muffin tins</span> can all be repurposed into engaging puzzles that challenge your beagle's intellect and curiosity. The key is creativity and understanding your dog's individual preferences and abilities.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="beagle-puzzle-conclusion-section">
                <h2 class="beagle-puzzle-section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="beagle-puzzle-paragraph">
                    Creating DIY puzzle toys for your beagle doesn't require expensive materials or complex construction skills. By using common household items and understanding your dog's natural instincts, you can provide hours of mental stimulation that keeps your beagle happy, engaged, and mentally sharp. These activities strengthen the bond between you and your pet while addressing their inherent need for mental challenges and scent-based problem solving.
